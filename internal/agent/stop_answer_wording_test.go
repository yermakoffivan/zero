// anyErrorCount establishes that the tool failed consecutively without a
// success. It does NOT establish that every failure differed: five A, five B and
// two C reach the content-blind bound of 12 without any signature repeating six
// times, and three of those errors were shared. The old wording called that
// "each with a different error".
//
// The signature bound has the inverse problem. A denial streak keys on the
// CATEGORY, and the prose behind it embeds the path or command refused, so it
// differs on every call. Calling that "the same error" is false in the other
