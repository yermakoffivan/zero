// Package agentsessions reads the session transcripts other coding agents
// (Claude Code, Codex, Factory Droid, Pi, …) leave on the local disk and
// translates them into Zero session events, so work started elsewhere can be
// continued in Zero.
//
// Three rules hold for every adapter in this package, and the tests enforce
// them rather than trusting the code to be careful:
//
//  1. READ ONLY. Nothing here writes to, moves, or locks another agent's store.
//
//  2. PATH-EXACT, NEVER A WALK. Every one of these agents keeps live
//     credentials in the same directory tree as its transcripts —
//     ~/.codex/auth.json, ~/.grok/auth.json, ~/.factory/auth.v2.key, and
//     most pointedly ~/.pi/agent/auth.json, which is the sibling of
//     ~/.pi/agent/sessions/. A filepath.WalkDir rooted one level too high
//     reads a live OAuth token. So discovery uses fixed-depth globs against a
//     specific extension and nothing else. This is repo invariant #2
//     (allow-lists, not deny-lists) applied to filesystem input.
//
//  3. IMPORTED TEXT IS UNTRUSTED (invariant #8). Every string crossing into
//     Zero's event log goes through internal/redaction first (invariant #6:
//     redaction is a chokepoint, not a sprinkle) — a foreign transcript can
//     easily contain a key the other agent echoed into its own log.

// file belongs in Read, not here.
