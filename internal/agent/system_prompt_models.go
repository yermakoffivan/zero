// Gemini benefits from explicit tool-preference and conciseness guidance. The

// comment discipline is universal in the core prompt now, so every family gets it.
// modelPromptAddendum returns the family-specific block appended after the core
// prompt, or "" when the family is unknown or needs no specialization.
// Classification is by model id (the agent only has the model string — no registry

- Output your final responses in GitHub-flavored Markdown: headings to structure
  longer answers, fenced code blocks for code, and ` + "`inline code`" + ` for paths,
  commands, and symbols.
- Strongly prefer the native file tools (read_file, list_directory, grep, glob,
  write_file, apply_patch) over shelling out to cat/sed/awk/python for
  file work. Make one tool call per file; do not batch file writes into a script.
- Persist until the task is fully handled this turn: gather context, implement,
  run the validators, and report — do not stop at a partial result.

const geminiPromptAddendum = `<model_guidance>
- Prefer the dedicated tools (read_file, grep, glob, apply_patch) over
  equivalent shell commands; they are safer and produce cleaner diffs.
- Be concise and concrete. When you run a shell command with side effects, state
  in one short clause why it is needed.
- Use update_plan only for work with at least three meaningful dependent steps;
  skip it for simple lookups and never create one after the work is complete.
