// compiling to disk. Nothing reads the flag today, which is exactly why it could
// be wrong quietly; the first reader would have inherited the bug.

// The classification alone grants nothing: no policy or runner code reads
// LocalServer, so treating a serving command as local-only only removed the
// approval it used to get, and the command then ran under the default deny
// profile. On Linux that is a network namespace and on macOS it is
// (deny network*), so the server started unprompted and could not serve a
// preview to the operator's browser.
//
// The package-manager cases are the sharper half. "npm run dev" is matched by
// SCRIPT NAME, and the repository decides what "dev" and "predev" actually do;
// either can curl before anything binds a port. On Windows the approval gate IS
// the network protection, so inferring no-egress from a name lets that through
// unprompted.
