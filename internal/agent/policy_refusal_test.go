// UNCATEGORIZED REFUSALS MUST STILL COUNT.

// The halt guard asked DenialReason != DenialNone, but a category is only
// attached where a TYPED denial is built. A headless run leaves
// OnPermissionRequest nil, so the loop never reaches that branch and the
// registry returns a bare "Error: Permission required ..." with no category. A
// sandbox preflight denial on a non-shell tool loses its SandboxDecision in the
// conversion and arrives as an uncategorized "Sandbox block".
//
// Both were counted as SUCCESS, which cleared the very record the guard
// accumulates, so the same refused call could repeat to MaxTurns. That is the
// loop this PR exists to stop.
