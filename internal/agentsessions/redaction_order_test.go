// redact() strips control bytes and matches secrets by shape. The order decides
// whether it works at all: matching first lets a transcript split a credential
// with a byte the stripper then deletes, rejoining the halves after the patterns
// have already declined to match them. Every shape leaked that way.
//
// This is the same defect as #835, where an MCP failure reason was redacted
// before the terminal sanitizer rejoined its halves, so the test is written to
// fail loudly rather than to describe the current behaviour.
//
// A foreign transcript is untrusted input by construction, which is what makes
// this worth a dedicated test: the whole feature is reading one.
